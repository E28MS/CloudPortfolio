##  What is Terraform?
Terraform is an opensource Infrastructure as Code Tool that can be used to provision resources in the cloud.  Instead of manually provisioning resources one by one, you provision the infrastructure you want to create using a configuration file that contains code specifying the resources required and how they are configured.  The files are written in HashiCorp Configuration Languagle (HCL) or JSON.  

These files specify the resources required and their configurations, enabling automated and consistent resource management.

Terraform can be used accross mutliple Cloud platforms, including Azure, AWS and Google Cloud
