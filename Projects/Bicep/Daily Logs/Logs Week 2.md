## Day Report (1 liner)
Today I created a document template for my existing infrastructure and started describing the existing infrastructure.

## Difficulties
It was difficult to know where to find a template and my search results online either lead to paid products or to information about IaC tools.  I was tempted to look at previous students documentation but I wanted to have my first draft done before I did this so as not to influence my efforts.

## Solutions
I went through several blogs and GitHub pages and then structured an appropriate question for ChatGPT who provided a template.
I haven't looked at the previous students portfolio's yet, I will do so once I've done my first draft.

## Learnings
I feel I will learn more by doing things myself, even if I make mistakes.
