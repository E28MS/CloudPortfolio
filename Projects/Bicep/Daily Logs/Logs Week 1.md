## Day Report
Today I installed Bicep Extention for VS Studio Code and worked on my Bicep Project Github portfolio.

## Difficulties
My picture for the diagram of the existing arhitecture is rendering incorrectly with a dark background.  I am struggling to envisage the layout of my portfolio in order to structure it appropriately.

## Troubleshooting process/ Solutions
I saved diagram as .png and then edited it in Paint, but this didn't resolve it.  I decided to spend my time elsewhere and return to this periodically as it's not preventing me from progressing with my project.


## Learnings
A reminder to myself not to get bogged down in the less relevant details as my focus is on producing working code.

## Day Report
Today I mounted Cloud Storage on my Azure subscription 

## Difficulties
My VS Code Terminal wouldn't launch.

## Troubleshooting process/ Solutions
First, I read up about common issues in VS Code Help section and went through the thoubleshooting one step at at time.  Unresolved.  Next, I consulted ChatGPT and troubleshooted extensions by removing and re-installing 9 Azure extensions manually.  Then I deleted my Azure storage and re-created it and finally I re-installed node.js. Issue resolved! 


## Learnings
A reminder that regardless of how keen I am to start building stuff, sometimes I just have to channel my inner Yoda and stay calm while carrying on with troubleshooting.
