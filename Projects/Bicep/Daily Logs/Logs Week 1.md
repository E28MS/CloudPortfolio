## Day Report
Today I installed Bicep Extention for VS Studio Code and worked on my Bicep Project Github portfolio.

## Difficulties
My picture for the diagram of the existing arhitecture is rendering incorrectly with a dark background.  I am struggling to envisage the layout of my portfolio in order to structure it appropriately.

## Troubleshooting process/ Solutions
I saved diagram as .png and then edited it in Paint, but this didn't resolve it.  I decided to spend my time elsewhere and return to this periodically as it's not preventing me from progressing with my project.


## Learnings
A reminder to myself not to get bogged down in the less relevant details as my focus is on producing working code.
