###  In this section, I captured my progress for learning Bicep by watching tutorials


In order to gain a solid foundation in Bicep, I followed along with tutorials from Azure World on YouTube

Here I deployed a Bicep file from Video 3: Hello World, using the following command in PowerShell:

    PS C:\Users\elmar> az deployment group create --resource-group bicepproject --templ
    ate-file "C:\Users\elmar\OneDrive\templates\testhelloworld.bicep"
