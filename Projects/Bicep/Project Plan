### Project Plan

These are the steps I will follow to complete this project.  This is a work in progress as I learn while doing the project and as I gain understanding of the requirements of the deliverables.

1.  Adjust project documentation from the original to be a suitable format for my version for a single person  
2.  Read and understand requirements for deliverables and break this down into week by week sections
3.  Read Learn Microsoft Documentation on Bicep
4.  Creat a document for existing infrastructure, including assumptions
5.  Create a Design Document, including reasons for making decisions
6.  Create Bicep templates to migrate existing infrastructure to Azure
7.  Launch templates
