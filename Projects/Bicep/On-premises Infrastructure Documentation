# Design Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides detailed information about the design and architecture of the application. It includes details on Network Security Group (NSG) rules, the deployment process, 
and diagrams to visualize the architecture and improvements in version 1.1.

## Existing Architecture
Describe the existing architecture of your application. Include an overview of the components and how they interact.

## Network Security Group (NSG) Rules
Provide detailed information about the NSG rules you have chosen. Include explanations for each rule and why it was selected.

### Example NSG Rule
| Rule Name       | Priority | Source      | Source Port | Destination | Destination Port | Protocol | Action |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|----------|--------|
| AllowWebTraffic | 100      | Any         | Any         | Any         | 80, 443          | TCP      | Allow  |
| DenyAllInbound  | 200      | Any         | Any         | Any         | Any              | Any      | Deny   |

## Deployment Process
Detail the steps and order in which your application is deployed in the cloud. This section should cover the practical and technical aspects of the deployment.

### Deployment Steps
1. **Provision Infrastructure**:
   - Create virtual networks and subnets.
   - Set up NSG and associate it with the subnets.

2. **Deploy Application Components**:
   - Deploy web servers.
   - Deploy application servers.
   - Deploy database servers.

3. **Configure Load Balancer**:
   - Set up load balancer with appropriate rules.

4. **Apply NSG Rules**:
   - Apply NSG rules to control traffic.

5. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Perform health checks and verify that all components are working as expected.

## Visualizations
Include diagrams that illustrate the architecture and the deployment process. For version 1.1, provide diagrams to substantiate the adjustments and improvements.
