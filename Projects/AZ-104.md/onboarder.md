###  Project Outline

## Onboard Automator (AZ-104 Module 1: Manage Azure identities and governance)
Streamline and automate the process of onboarding a new employee into Entra ID and assigning necessary Azure resources.

- **Programming required?**: ‚ùå
- **Azure Services Used:**
  - Entra ID
  - Azure Logic Apps
  - Azure Email Service (part of Logic Apps connector)
  - Azure Resource Manager
  
- **Steps**:
   1. **Entra ID Setup**:
        - Set up a new Entra ID instance (if not already present) using the Azure portal.
   
   2. **Logic App Workflow Design**:
        - Design a Logic App workflow triggered by an event (like an entry in a SharePoint list or an email to a specific mailbox) indicating a new employee hire.
   
   3. **Azure AD User Creation**:
        - Use the Azure AD connector in Logic Apps to automatically create a new user in Azure AD based on the trigger event's details.
   
   4. **Role and Group Assignment**:
        - Assign predefined roles and groups to the new user based on the job position or department indicated in the trigger.
   
   5. **Resource Provisioning**:
        - Use the Azure Resource Manager connector in Logic Apps to provision any necessary Azure resources for the user (like VMs or specific permissions).
   
   6. **Welcome Email**:
        - Leverage the Email connector in Logic Apps to send a welcome email to the new hire with instructions and necessary access details.
   
   7. **Monitoring and Review**:
        - Monitor and review the onboarding process through Logic Apps runs history and Azure AD logs to ensure smooth operations.

###  Difficulties and Troubleshooting

##  Getting stuck on step 2:
I had persistant difficulties getting past Step 2 as I couldn't get a trigger  to connect succesfully with Entra ID to create a new user.  I kept getting an error message that stated that I needed a work or school account to make the connection.

Steps I took to resolve this:
*  I tried to use different triggers.(HTTP, Gmail, Outlook)

*  I registered the Logic App in Entra ID, granting User.Read.Write.All and Admin Priveleges (see Includes for details)


Solutions:
After scrutinizing my app from start to finish, I realised that I was using an HTTP action instead of an HTTP Trigger as the first building block of my logic app.  

##  BedRequest Error:
After adding the next HTTP Action (1), I get getting a BadRequest error.  This seemed to have something to do with the way I structured the user information I entered in Postman and how that then gets interpreted by by the LogicApp.  

Here is the inputs from the HTTP 1 Action:

{
    "uri": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users",
    "method": "POST",
    "headers": {
        "Authorization": "*sanitized*",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "body": {
        "accountEnabled": true,
        "displayName": "EsmeraldaWeatherwax",
        "mailNickname": "EsmeraldaWeatherwax",
        "userPrincipalName": "Esmeralda.Weatherwax@example.com",
        "passwordProfile": {
            "forceChangePasswordNextSignIn": true,
            "password": "DefaultPassword123!"
        }
    }
}

Solutions:
Firstly, I tried to clarify in my mind what the error was.  Using the JSON schemas from Postman and the LogicApp to compare was very useful here.

##  Forbidden Error
The BadRequest error sooned deteriorated into a Forbidden error, so I went back through to check the permissions provided earlier for my LogicApp in Entra ID.  Specifically, I wanted to check if I granted Group.ReadWrite.All and Directory.ReadWrite.All, as I know that I granted User.ReadWrite.All.

I found that I didn't previously assign anything apart from User.ReadWrite.All:

But searching for Group.ReadWrite.All and Directory.ReadWrite.All didn't bring these options up.  So back to the drawing board.


## Outcomes

##  Summary of Steps:
###  HTTP Trigger (User data from Postman).

Here I set up the HTTP Trigger and added the details of the user I wanted to create in Postman:

###  HTTP Action (Get access token from Azure AD).

This first HTTP action is used to connect to Entra ID and get the access token.

###  Parse JSON (Extract access token).

The Parse JSON is used to get the access token from the body of the previous HTTP Acton

HTTP Action (Use Microsoft Graph API to create the user).

###  Here I set up the next HTTP action , using Microsoft Graph API to create the new user:
