###  Difficulties and Troubleshooting

I had persistant difficulties getting past Step 2 as I couldn't get a trigger  to connect succesfully with Entra ID to create a new user.  I kept getting an error message that stated that I needed a work or school account to make the connection.

Steps I took to resolve this:
*  I tried to use different triggers.(HTTP, Gmail, Outlook)

*  I registered the Logic App in Entra ID, granting User.Read.Write.All and Admin Priveleges (see Includes for details)


Solutions:
After scrutinizing my app from start to finish, I realised that I was using an HTTP action instead of an HTTP Trigger as the first building block of my logic app.
