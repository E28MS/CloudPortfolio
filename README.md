# CloudPortfolio

This is my portfolio that I am working on while I'm looking for work as a Junior Cloud Engineer.  

It has 2 main sections that I want to share: My Projects and my Learning.  

Regarding Projects, at present I am doing a Bicep project and I am planning to also do a Terraform Project at a later stage.  

I am currently learning for my AZ-104 Azure Administrator Certificate and hope to gain this by end of 2024.
